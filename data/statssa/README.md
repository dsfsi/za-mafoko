# About

The Multilingual Statistical Terminology Project by Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) aims to enhance access to statistical information for all South Africans, acknowledging that only 9.6% of the population speaks English as their first language. Initiated in 2008, this project developed statistical terminology in the 10 official languages of South Africa, in addition to English. This effort involved collaboration from language specialists across government, academia, and the private sector. By removing linguistic barriers, Stats SA seeks to ensure that all citizens can understand and engage with crucial statistical data, fostering a deeper connection to the information that impacts their lives. The project supports the vision of a South Africa where everyone can say, "This is the home we understand because it speaks our languages."
