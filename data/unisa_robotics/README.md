# About

The UNISA Multilingual Robotics Glossary is a comprehensive collection of approximately 100 robotics and engineering terminology entries translated across South Africa's 11 official languages. This glossary was developed by the University of South Africa (UNISA) through its Inspired towards Science, Engineering and Technology (I-SET) program, in collaboration with the Department of Linguistics and Modern Languages and the Department of African Languages. This resource aims to make robotics education accessible in mother-tongue languages throughout South Africa, supporting STEM education and bridging the gap between technical terminology and linguistic diversity.
