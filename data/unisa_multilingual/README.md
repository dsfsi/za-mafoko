# About

The South African Multilingual Linguistic Terminology (SAMLT) Project is a comprehensive multilingual termbank containing 500 linguistic terms translated across nine South African languages. Each term includes translations by field experts, accompanied by concise definitions and usage examples to clarify technical linguistic concepts for classroom and academic use. This resource addresses the critical need for standardized linguistic terminology in African languages, supporting linguistics education and research across South Africa's diverse linguistic landscape.
