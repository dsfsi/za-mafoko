# About

The purpose of the Open Resource Term Bank (OERTB) project is to support the collaborative development and dissemination of terminological resources, and thereby promoting the use of African languages in teaching and learning at higher education institutions. More specifically, the project is aimed at promoting the African languages as vehicles for comprehending threshold concepts in academic disciplines through practices such as translanguaging – the process and practice of shuttling between students’ home languages and English to facilitate comprehension, foster social cohesion and recognise students' linguistic identities.
