# About

The University of Pretoria Multilingual Academic Glossaries dataset is the result of an initiative by the University of Pretoria's Language Development Plan to promote linguistic diversity and increase access to academic information across three key South African official languages. The dataset includes multilingual equivalents for academic terms developed through the Language Development Plan, which is funded by the Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET) and the University of Pretoria.

This dataset aims to bridge linguistic barriers in higher education, ensuring that students and academics can understand key academic concepts across various disciplines in Afrikaans, English, and Northern Sotho (Sepedi). Supported by the University of Pretoria's multilingual language policy and commitment to academic excellence, this project reflects the institution's dedication to inclusivity and accessibility in higher education. By making academic terminology available in these three official languages, the dataset fosters educational engagement and pride in native languages, particularly supporting students who wish to engage with academic content in their home languages.

This initiative underscores the University of Pretoria's dedication to ensuring every student and academic can access and understand disciplinary knowledge, enhancing academic participation and informed scholarly discourse.
